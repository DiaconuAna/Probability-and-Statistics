% It is thought that the gas mileage obtained by a particular model of automo-
% bile will be higher if unleaded premium gasoline is used in the vehicle rather than
% regular unleaded gasoline. To gather evidence in this matter, 10 cars are randomly se-
% lected from the assembly line and tested using a specified brand of premium gasoline;
% 10 others are randomly selected and tested using the brand's regular gasoline. Tests
% are conducted under identical controlled conditions and gas mileages for both types
% of gas are assumed independent and (approximately) normally distributed.
% The data results are given

%   Premium            Regular
% 22.4  21.7    |    17.7  14.8 
% 24.5  23.4    |    19.6  19.6 
% 21.6  23.3    |    12.1  14.8 
% 22.4  21.6    |    15.4  12.6 
% 24.8  20.0    |    14.0  12.2
